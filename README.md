This is a simple sliding puzzle made using HTML/CSS/JS.

Most of the sliding puzzles that I found simply swapped the contents of tiles, but I wanted a more realistic looking result.

It was also my first attempt at making something look real using pure CSS, after being inspired by seeing things like [this](http://codepen.io/AntonEssenetial/pen/trlfu).
